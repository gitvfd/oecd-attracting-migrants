Hi Vincent,
As I promised, please find attached:
· A screenshot of the country results tab with my modifications
· The data to be used for the country results tab -> pearl charts
· The data to be used for the dimensions tab (including the quartile information) -> lollipop charts
I still need to send you the data for the indicators tab. However, I’ve just realised that we did not discuss a super important point about this tab, which may change the way I need to share with you the data. Would you be available for a quick call so that I can explain you better what is the problem?
Many thanks!
Michele


Hi Vincent,
 
As discussed over the phone, please find attached the data to be used for the indicators tab.
 
The additional column is titled “penalty”. The way the penalty is added in the indicators is that, after users have chosen the weights of the 7 dimensions and we have the aggregate measure, this should be just multiplied by the penalty.
 
I remain at your disposal for any clarification.
 
Have a great long weekend.
Michele
